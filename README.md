## The Problem

> **Enterprise execution doesn't fail because goals aren't written. It fails because no one can see when execution is breaking down — until it's too late.**

At scale, organizations face a structural visibility problem:

- Goal sheets live in spreadsheets and disconnected tools — **there is no execution control plane**
- Managers approve goals without risk context — **approvals become rubber stamps**
- Governance teams react to failures after quarterly reviews — **there is no early warning system**
- Audit trails exist only in emails and meeting notes — **accountability is unenforceable**
- Escalation is ad-hoc and untracked — **operational bottlenecks become invisible**

AlignOps is the layer that closes this gap. It is a **governance operating system** — not a productivity app — built to make execution, risk, and accountability observable at every level of an organization.

---

##  Intelligence Layer

AlignOps ships a **deterministic execution health engine** — no external AI API costs, no hallucination risk, no rate limiting. Every signal is rule-based, reproducible, and auditable.

| Engine | What It Detects | Where It Surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| **SMART Scorer** | Per-criterion quality signals across Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound axes | Employee cockpit · Manager approval view |
| **KPI Deduplication** | Similar KPI titles across an employee's active goal sheets | Employee cockpit warning · Manager risk view |
| **Risk Scorer** | Unrealistic target delta, vague measurement language, weight distribution imbalance | Manager risk radar · Admin heatmap |
| **Workload Balancer** | Goal count vs organizational baseline, total weight sum validation | Employee cockpit · Manager queue |
| **Health Scorer** | Composite of latest progress, check-in recency, and achievement trajectory (0–100) | Manager team view · Admin heatmap |
| **Forecast Engine** | P(achieve) at cycle-end based on current progress rate and trajectory | Employee cockpit · Admin lifecycle matrix |
| **Governance Heuristics** | Approval SLA breach, submission deadline risk, check-in gap detection | Escalation engine · Admin escalation tracker |

---

##  Architecture Principles

**Separation of Concerns** — Each business module (`goals`, `checkins`, `escalations`, `audit`, `reporting`, `org`, `shared-goals`) owns its own schema-facing services. Cross-module coordination is explicit, never implicit.

**DAL Boundary** — All database access goes through a typed Data Access Layer. No raw Prisma calls in route handlers or UI. Every persistence operation is instrumentable, testable, and auditable.

**RBAC at Every Layer** — Role enforcement happens at three independent checkpoints: Next.js middleware (session-level), API route handlers (request-level), and DAL service calls (data-level). Bypassing one layer does not bypass the system.

**Immutable Audit Ledger** — All governance-relevant events — approvals, returns, unlocks, escalations — are written to an append-only audit log table. The application never deletes audit records.

**Server-First Rendering** — React Server Components serve the majority of UI. Client components are used only where interactivity demands it. This reduces client JavaScript, improves load performance, and keeps sensitive data server-side.

**Extensibility by Default** — Role claim normalization is Entra-ready. The notification model is a structured queue with provider-agnostic dispatch — real Teams/email integration requires only a provider implementation, not an architecture change.

##  Demo Credentials

> Use password `AlignOps@123` for all demo accounts.

| Role | Email | Story Arc |
|---|---|---|
|  **Admin** | `aditi.rao@alignops.local` | HR governance owner. Sees full org execution health, runs audit intelligence, manages unlock interventions, exports compliance reports. |
|  **Manager (Overloaded)** | `rohan.mehta@alignops.local` | Product manager under pressure. High-risk approval queue, active escalations, overloaded team, Teams notification preview in action. |
|  **Manager (Healthy)** | `manav.shah@alignops.local` | Sales manager with a healthy operating rhythm. Approved sheets, lower risk signals, good team distribution. |
|  **Employee (Thriving)** | `nisha.iyer@alignops.local` | Strong progress, high KPI confidence, clean SMART scores, forecast shows on-track to exceed. |
|  **Employee (At-Risk)** | `aman.gupta@alignops.local` | Duplicate KPI signals, unrealistic target warnings, at-risk forecast — the intelligence engine working in real-time. |
|  **Employee (Escalated)** | `kabir.ali@alignops.local` | Delayed draft, active escalation event, visible in manager and admin views. |

---

##  Demo Flow

*Optimized for a 7-minute judging window. Tells a connected operating story from employee quality signal to admin governance impact.*

### Act 1 — Employee Execution (90 seconds)
1. Log in as **nisha.iyer** → show Goal Cockpit: progress rings, KPI confidence, forecast, quarterly timeline
2. Show SMART scoring panel — how each criterion is evaluated in real-time
3. Log in as **aman.gupta** → show duplicate KPI warning, unrealistic target signal, at-risk forecast
4. *Establishes: the platform catches quality problems before they become governance problems*

### Act 2 — Manager Governance (2.5 minutes)
5. Log in as **rohan.mehta** → open Manager Operating Center
6. Show prioritized approval queue — risk-ranked submissions with execution health scores
7. Open one high-risk goal sheet — execution risk radar live on the approval screen
8. Return the risky goal with a comment → notification triggers to employee
9. Approve a clean submission → audit event written
10. Show escalation radar — kabir.ali's escalation is active
11. Show Teams notification card preview
12. *Establishes: managers make risk-informed decisions, not blind approvals*

### Act 3 — Admin Governance (3 minutes)
13. Log in as **aditi.rao** → open Admin Governance Control Tower
14. Show org execution health score, department heatmap
15. Open Lifecycle Matrix — all active goal sheets by state
16. Open Audit Intelligence — approval events, return events, escalation entries
17. Open Escalation Tracker — show kabir.ali's escalation thread end-to-end
18. Open Unlock Intervention Center — auditable unlock/relock flow with reason capture
19. Open Reports → export CSV → show thrust-area analysis, UoM distribution, QoQ trend
20. *Establishes: governance is observable, auditable, and exportable*

### The Winning Moment
> Employee goal quality problem → manager receives risk-aware notification → manager governs with execution context → admin observes org-wide governance impact → compliance export produced.
>
> **That is a complete enterprise governance loop.**

##  Tech Stack — Decisions

| Technology | Why |
|---|---|
| **Next.js 14 App Router** | Server-first rendering eliminates data-fetching waterfalls. Protected route groups enforce RBAC at the routing layer. RSC keeps sensitive business logic server-side. |
| **TypeScript (strict)** | Enterprise codebases require type safety. Strict mode catches data contract violations at compile time. DAL type signatures make schema changes visible everywhere immediately. |
| **Prisma ORM** | Type-safe database access with schema-as-code. Migration history lives in the repository. Enums and relations are enforced at the ORM layer, not just in SQL. |
| **PostgreSQL via Supabase** | Relational integrity for a governance system is non-negotiable. Foreign keys, audit constraints, and hierarchical org structures require relational semantics. Supabase adds managed auth and connection pooling. |
| **Supabase Auth** | JWT-based sessions with metadata for role claims. Entra SSO integration requires only a provider configuration change — no auth architecture rewrite. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS eliminates stylesheet bloat at scale. Design consistency from a constrained token system. Dark/light theming is trivial with CSS variables. |
| **Zod** | Runtime validation at API boundaries with TypeScript inference. Every form submission and API payload is validated before it reaches the DAL. |

---

##  Scalability Roadmap

AlignOps is a modular monolith by design. The architecture supports the following production evolution without structural rewrites:

| Capability | Path |
|---|---|
| **Entra SSO** | Supabase Auth provider configuration + existing role claim normalization layer — no auth architecture change |
| **Real Teams/Email Notifications** | Implement provider interface in notification dispatcher; schema and queue are already in place |
| **Real-time Dashboard Updates** | Supabase Realtime subscriptions on goal sheet and audit tables |
| **Background Escalation Jobs** | Connect escalation rule evaluation to Vercel Cron — evaluation logic already exists |
| **Multi-cycle Historical Analytics** | Schema supports multiple cycles; reporting layer adds cycle-comparison queries |
| **Observability** | Structured logging middleware at DAL boundary; audit ledger is already the event source |
| **Module Extraction** | Each `src/modules/*` is a bounded context — extractable to a separate service if org scale demands it |

**AlignOps** · AtomQuest Hackathon 1.0

When escalations are untracked, execution breaks down invisibly.

**AlignOps closes the gap.**
